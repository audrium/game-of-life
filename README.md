# Game Of Life

"Game of Life" invented by John Conway is a cellular automaton meant to simulate the development of a population of cells. Each cell behaves according to the following simple rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Implementation of Conway's game is done in JavaScript using React.js
